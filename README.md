# Metal-Concentrations-in-Drinking-Water-and-Public-Perception-of-Water-Quality-in-the-Arizona-Border

**Abstract**
Background
There is an intricate relationship between drinking water quality and perception along the Arizona-Mexico border. In a region marked by water scarcity, cross-border policies, and socioeconomic disparities, this community-engaged study conducted in two border towns examines the (1) metal(loid) concentration in drinking water sources, (2) factors influencing drinking water quality perceptions among residents and their impact on water usage behaviors, and (3) sociocultural, economic, and educational influences on environmental health literacy and self-determination.
Methods
This study adopts a mixed-methods approach by combining quantitative water quality analysis (testing for nineteen metal(loid)s, including arsenic and lead, across public water, private wells, and pipas) and two qualitative semi-structured surveys (an environmental and a health survey)
Results
The results showed all contaminants were below EPA maximum contaminants level. Arsenic concentration ranged from 0.0159 to 4.03ug/L while lead concentration ranged from 0.00852 to 6.08215ug/L. While the inorganic contaminants concentrations in this study stayed below the EPA maximum contaminant level (MCL), concentrations of arsenic and lead above zero showed exceedances of the US-EPA maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG).  Perceptions varied depending on the water source, with public water viewed more favorably than private wells or pipas. Education emerged as the key driver of enhanced pro-environmental behaviors. Discrepancies between perceived and actual water quality emphasize the need for targeted communication and education initiatives. 
Conclusion
Understanding the nexus between water quality results and perception in this region has implications for policy formulation, allocation of household resources, and public health interventions. Addressing misconceptions and bolstering transparency can cultivate trust in water sources and encourage responsible water use and community well-being. The study underscores the importance of multidisciplinary approaches in tackling water-related challenges and underscores the role of accurate information in shaping perceptions and behaviors surrounding drinking water.
